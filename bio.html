            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was born on Long Island, New York. I grew up about 40 miles east of New York City. As a kid I was always outside playing sports. I was rarely ever inside on the computer or playing video games. </p>
            <p>As a child I was into designing and creating things, mainly fashion. I also liked drawing. I never took any of it seriously outside of hobbies. In 2014 my senior year in high school I tried coding for the first time and I made a small bird move across the screen and sit on an egg. It was interesting, the class was short only for a week so I didnâ€™t get to fully grasp and explore coding.</p>
            <p>After I graduated high school I joined the Navy as an aircraft mechanic. I enjoyed being in the military and being an aircraft mechanic. Along the way I always found the technology that the aircraft was using fascinating. The aircrafts that I was working on were essentially giant radars and were some of the most technically advanced aircraft in the military. My interest in how these systems worked eventually led me to start looking for technical careers.</p>
            <p>I did lots of research on all the different options I could choose and software engineering seemed like the best fit for me. The next step was to find a good school to learn from. I had no experience in the field of software engineering. During my search, my uncle who is also a software engineer suggested that I check out flatiron school.  I loved the program and got enrolled into the school. So here I am an aspiring software engineer getting ready to start my new journey.</p>

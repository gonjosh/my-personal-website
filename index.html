        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I was born and raised in Long Island, New York. As a kid I was always outside playing sports I was rarely ever inside on the computer or paying video games. Growing up I always into designing and creating things mainly fashion and drawings but never took it seriously. In 2014 my senior year in high school I tried coding for the first time and I made a small bird move across the screen and sit on an egg. It was interesting but the class was only for a week so I didnâ€™t get to fully grasp and explore this field. Once I graduated high school I joined the Navy as an aircraft mechanic. I enjoyed being in the military and being a aircraft mechanic but I was more interested in the technology that the aircraft was using. The aircrafts that I was working on were essentially giant radars and were some of the most technically advanced aircraft in the military. My interest in how these systems worked eventually led me to start looking for technical careers. I did a lots of research on all the different routes I could choose and software engineering seemed like the best fit for me. The next step was to find good school to learn from because I have no experience in this field. During my search my uncle that is also a software engineer suggested that I check out flatiron school.  I loved the program and got enrolled  into the school. Now Here I am an aspiring software engineer getting ready to start my new journey. </p>
